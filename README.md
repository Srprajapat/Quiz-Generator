## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the Quiz Generator running on your local machine.

### 1\. Prerequisites

  * Python 3.8 or newer
  * Git

### 2\. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quiz-generator.git
cd quiz-generator
```

### 3\. Create a Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

  * **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
  * **On Windows:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

### 4\. Install Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```txt
streamlit
google-generativeai
python-dotenv
```

Then, install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5\. Set Up Your API Key üîë

You need a Google API key to use the Gemini model.

1.  Generate an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`.
3.  Add your API key to the `.env` file as shown below:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```

-----

## How to Run the Application ‚ñ∂Ô∏è

With your environment activated and the `.env` file in place, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server, and the application will open in a new tab in your web browser.

-----

## File Structure üìÇ

The project is structured as follows:

```
quiz-generator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env              # Stores your API key (not committed to Git)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py            # The main Streamlit application script
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt  # Lists the Python dependencies
```
